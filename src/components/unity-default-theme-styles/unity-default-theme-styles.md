# unity-default-theme-styles

## Changelog:

### v1.0.4
- Change colors to use new colors. Include formats and uses for future color placement redesigns. Still has old color use format until all components are updated.

### v1.0.0
- Changed --default-unity-button-padding variable to set just the value of one side instead of full padding (i.e.: changed from 0 20px to just 20px). This is so that we can apply padding to each side selectively.
